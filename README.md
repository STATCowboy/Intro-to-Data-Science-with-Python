# Introduction to Data Science with Python
In this [Houston Data Science][1] meetup we will introduce our members to data science using the Python programming language.

# Install Python 3 on your own BEFORE coming to class
Follow the tutorial in the [Intro to Python][2] repository in order to install the Anaconda distribution with Python 3.

# Agenda
Cover the following Python data science libraries
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Statsmodels
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## Jupyter Notebook
We have finally arrived at my personal favorite environment for doing data science. Jupyter Notebooks provide a web-based interface to a number of different programming languages. The project was originally titled "iPython notebook" and was specifically built for just iPython as a backend. It turned out that notebooks are a very popular way to develop. To accomodate other languages that project was retitled Jupyter for the languages **JU**lia, **PY**thon and **R**. The Jupyter project now works with over 50 different language "kernels" of which IPython is just one.

The rest of this tutorial will take place in Jupyter Notebooks.

> 1. Open a terminal and run `jupyter notebook`
> 1. Open up the first notebook `0 Jupyter Intro`
